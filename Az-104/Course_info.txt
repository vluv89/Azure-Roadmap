Survey Note: Comprehensive Analysis of Azure-104 Lab Materials
This section provides a detailed exploration of the resources available for practicing Azure-104 lab materials, ensuring a thorough understanding for certification preparation. The analysis is based on official Microsoft resources and aligns with the current certification requirements as of March 21, 2025.

Background and Certification Overview
The AZ-104 certification, known as Microsoft Certified: Azure Administrator Associate, is designed for IT professionals who manage and monitor an organization’s Azure environment. It covers areas such as virtual networks, storage, compute, identity, security, and governance. The certification is critical for those aiming to demonstrate expertise in implementing Azure solutions, often as part of a larger team coordinating with networking, security, and DevOps roles.

Research suggests that hands-on practice is essential for mastering these skills, and Microsoft provides various resources to support this. The certification is set for an update on April 18, 2025, with the English version being updated first, followed by localized versions approximately eight weeks later. Most exam questions cover general availability (GA) features, but may include Preview features if commonly used, which is an important consideration for lab practice.

Detailed Lab Materials
The primary resource identified is the official Microsoft Learning GitHub repository, located at this repository. This repository contains 14 detailed labs, each focusing on specific aspects of Azure administration. The labs are part of Microsoft’s training materials and are designed to provide practical, hands-on experience. The following table lists the labs and their focus areas:

Lab Number	Lab Title	Focus Area
1	LAB_01-Manage_Entra_ID_Identities	Managing Microsoft Entra ID identities
2a	LAB_02a_Manage_Subscriptions_and_RBAC_Entra	Managing subscriptions and RBAC with Entra ID
2b	LAB_02b-Manage_Governance_via_Azure_Policy	Implementing governance using Azure Policy

These labs are accessible via individual HTML files on the GitHub page, with each lab providing step-by-step instructions. The required lab files can be downloaded from this link, ensuring users have all necessary resources for practice. This repository is maintained by Microsoft Learning, making it an authoritative source for certification preparation.

Additional Resources and Considerations
While the GitHub labs are comprehensive, Microsoft Learn also offers supplementary resources. For instance, the study guide for Exam AZ-104, available at Exam AZ-104 study guide, recommends training and hands-on experience, including self-paced learning paths and modules. However, specific lab links within Microsoft Learn were not as detailed as the GitHub repository, suggesting the latter is the primary source for structured practice.

An unexpected detail is the integration of community support and video resources on Microsoft Learn, such as the Exam Readiness Zone at Exam Readiness Zone and Azure Fridays at Azure Fridays. These can complement lab practice by providing visual guidance and community insights, though they are not direct lab materials.

The certification update on April 18, 2025, includes minor changes, particularly in storage configuration, as outlined in the study guide. The evidence leans toward the current labs remaining relevant, given their broad coverage of core topics. However, users should check the updated study guide post-April 18, 2025, for any new lab requirements.

Practical Implementation
To use the labs, users need an Azure subscription, which can be obtained through a free account or an existing subscription. The labs are designed for intermediate-level IT professionals, aligning with the course duration of 4 days as noted in official training descriptions. This hands-on approach is crucial for mastering tasks like deploying ARM templates, configuring network security groups, and implementing Azure Monitor alerts, all of which are tested in the exam.

Conclusion
In summary, the official Microsoft Learning GitHub repository provides the most detailed and structured lab materials for practicing Azure-104 skills. With 14 labs covering all major topics, downloadable files, and step-by-step instructions, it is the go-to resource for hands-on preparation. Users should also leverage Microsoft Learn for additional training and be aware of the upcoming certification update, ensuring their practice aligns with the latest requirements.
